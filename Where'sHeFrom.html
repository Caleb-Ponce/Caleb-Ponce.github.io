        <p>We rescued Buster through Canine Connections. An orginization that goes down to sothern California and gathers as many stay dogs as they can fit in their rescue van. They bring them to Echo Glen Childrens center, a juvinile detention center where well behaved children get rewarded by learning to train dogs. But we got to adopt him because he was a little too agressive. (also his name was Tickle... horrible name)</p></div>
