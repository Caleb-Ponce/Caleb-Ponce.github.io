        <p> I got to thake Buster with me this year because he likes to get into anything edible within his reach. He can be kind of a handful, espsually when left to his own devises. He once got into where we store his food and just ate and ate. he puffed up like a ballon! (no pics, you're welcome) Rest assured he won't be doing that again any time soon. This is my first year owning a dog on my own and its been pretty great so far!</p>
